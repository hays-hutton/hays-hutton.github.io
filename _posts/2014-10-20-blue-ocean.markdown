Six years ago I became the president of an auto body repair company that had overexpanded and burned through most of it's cash. The previous president of the company quit since he thought the business was finished. Within the first few weeks, the controller and his assistant also quit. We weren't making money. Our competitors were both big and well funded. It was a daunting position especially for someone who had never led a multi-state, multi-location organization with over seventy-five employees.

At first I didn't think about strategy, everything was just about keeping things afloat. In some ways, it was an exciting challenge. I had a great operations team still and we pulled together. We "righted the ship" which was quite an accomplishment. But then we were stuck running a break even operation in a competitive business without any capital. What to do?

I don't remember exactly when I picked up [Blue Ocean Strategy][1] , but I know that I immediately recognized the "red ocean" of price competition, copycat marketing, and similar strategies for all the players in our markets. I needed to find some calm waters. Some calm waters that we could actually get to from where we were.

# The Insight

Eighty per cent of the jobs we had fixing wrecks were referred to us by an insurance company. In essence, the claims divisions of these big companies were our biggest customers by far. What one realizes when you start to really think about it is the following: our biggest customers were basically the largest expense item on their company's P&L statements.

Our biggest customers "lived" on the expense side of their organization's income statements. How do you think they were rewarded and thought about their business?

# What To Do About It
Our biggest customers were price driven. We didn't have the size, nor did I have the know how, to compete on efficiency and cost from where we were at the time. 

We needed to change our customer base. We needed to find a customer that cared about what we already did well which was customer service. The answer was a funny thing. It was the "other side" of the P&L statements of the insurance companies. Who generated the revenue? Who really cared about having happy clients? It was the insurance agents. They were the income side. Their paychecks depended upon renewals which came from happy customers.

Once we decided that our top customer was the insurance agent things became easier. We started to behave differently. 100% customer satisfaction became the priority. If our insurance agents were going to refer us, we could never disappoint. Operationally we pivoted to satisfaction at almost any cost. It's how we measured ourselves. It's how people were bonused. It's how we marketed ourselves.

# Strategy Maps
One of the tools from [Blue Ocean Strategy][1] is the strategy map. It helped refine the idea of pivoting. It also helped communicate where we were going to the entire team. While not perfect, it was an invaluable tool.

# Success
[Blue Ocean Strategy][1] worked for us. We recently were acquired by some private equity backed companies. 

While we had challenges getting some staff comfortable with doing things no one else in our industry was doing, I attribute a great deal of  our ability to turn our business around and eventually end up with a favorable exit to [Blue Ocean Strategy][1].

Thank you Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne!
