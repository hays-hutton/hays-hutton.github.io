# One Metric to Rule Them All? #

In my [last post](/2014/10/28/ultimate-question), I described how we implemented and used the Net
Promoter System to turn around and save an ailing business. Now I'd
like to explore an idea that I worked out while running that Net
Promoter implementation for the last few years. As the president of the
company I had a unique view of how effective the Net Promoter system
was. I also started to realize after a few years of managing Net
Promoter without change that it was becoming stale. Our people were
executing. Our culture had changed. To some extent everyone went on
"autopilot". While it was a good "autopilot", it still seemed that as
an organization we weren't striving quite as much as when we had started.  If we hadn't sold the business I would
have given the ideas that follow a try.

# Basic Idea #

Any inbound communication other than an initial contact with your
organization means you messed up. In my plan, called Zero Score, every one of these is a +1 to your
score. Higher scores are bad. A perfect score would be 0. Hence the
name Zero Score. Each count in your Zero Score means either someone didn't follow up in
time or a client is unhappy about something or they just didn't have a
piece of information they wanted. If your clients are taking the time and
effort to call you, you missed something. These are opportunities your
organization should be acting upon. These are opportunities for a
better process, a new process, or some change in the behavior of your organization.

# Collecting and Tagging the Zero Score #
There are multiple ways to capture an inbound call. All of them can be
used to enhance the utility of the Zero Score by assigning the score
to a part of your organization. I call this assignment: tagging. Here
are some basic ideas about how to collect and tag a Zero Score:

* Turn your receptionist into a data collection champion. She is
already answering the call and deciding where it should be routed. The
"route" can be the tag. At the end of the day she can compile and send
an overall score for the organization and even a score for each
"division" or tag.
* Tag the call automatically by the last extension it ends on. Some
phone systems can provide this relatively easily. (e.g. If extension 709 is your service area and that is where the call ultimately
ends, then it's tagged "service". The "service" division's Zero Score
is +1 for this and when all of the divisions are "rolled up" then the
organization's score is +1 too.)
Good enough!
* Record all of your calls and have someone review them to tag and
  calculate the score.
* Do some combination of all of the above methods!

Once a Zero Score is tagged, it is more useful. You can look for
opportunities in different parts of your business to make the score better.  The best
part is everyone can do this. Everyone in your organization should be
doing this. That's the point with this kind of metric. As a leader,
you can manage many different people and activities with a simple and
transparent metric. With this kind of metric everything matters. Little things
matter and so do big. And while some of your people may not be able
to change big things there are always little things that matter to
your clients that they can fix. The Zero Score motivates this!

# Driving Organizational Change with a Simple Metric and a Simple Plan #
Start by just collecting the Zero Score for each
organizational unit and sharing the overall score for the organization
every day. This way you end up with a "baseline" to really start to work
from. After you have a "baseline" Zero Score for your particular business,
you can get more serious by looking for ways to incentivize
people based on the Zero Score that they have control over. At that
point, you should really engage with the people who show the most
promise by committing resources to help them change their processes to
get to a 0 on their Zero Score. Your ultimate goal!

# Zero Score Implications #
The Zero Score implies that every "touch" your organization makes other
than an initial sales inquiry should be outbound. It is an audacious
goal that assumes your organization knows more than it probably does
right now. Many people do amazing work when a lot is expected of them.
It ends up being "contagious" too because other people have to "up
their game" to keep up.


# Simple Is Good #
Think about it. It's relatively easy to capture. It can be "rolled up"
to the entire organization by time periods like day, week, or month.
It could even be sliced into "hours of the day" or even by divisions
like "sales" or "service" or even "accounting". You could do
derivatives such as Zero Score / transactions or Zero Score / revenue to compare across units with
different sales volumes. This is a useful metric!
