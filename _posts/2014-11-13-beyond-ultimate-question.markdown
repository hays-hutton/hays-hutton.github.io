# One Metric to Rule Them All? #

In my [last post](/2014/10/28/ultimate-question), I described how we implemented and used the Net
Promoter System to turn around and save an ailing business. In this
post I want to explore an idea I had after doing Net Promoter for a
number of years. A sytem that I believe that may be easier to implement and
possibly even more effective. I believe that if we hadn't sold the business I would
have given the ideas that follow a try.

# Basic Idea #

Any inbound communication other than an initial contact with your
organization means you messed up. Every one of these is a +1 to your
score. Higher scores are bad. A perfect score would be 0. Hence the
name Zero Score. Each count in your Zero Score means either someone didn't follow up in
time or a client is unhappy about something or they just didn't have a
piece of information they wanted. If your clients are taking the time and
effort to call you, I'd say you missed something. These represent opportunities your
organization could proactively act upon.

# Tagging the Zero Score #
There are multiple ways to capture and tag the type of an inbound
call:

* Turn your receptionist into a data collection champion. She is
already answering the call and deciding where it should be routed.
Have her "tag" it with a predetermined set of tags and compile it!
* Tag it automatically by the last extension the call ends on. (If it
made it to someone who provides "service" then it's tagged like that.)
Good enough!
* Record them all and have someone review them.
* All of the above!

Once the Zero Score is tagged it can be even more useful. You can
drill in and look for opportunities to make the score better. The best
part is everyone will want to fix the easy ones first. Little things
matter.

# Driving Organizational Change #
I am convinced I could have driven organizational change with such a
number. Which means almost everyone else could too. It would be easy
enough to collect and share on a daily basis at whichever
organizational level mattered most. If it were me, I would start by
just collecting and sharing the Zero Score for organization units and
overall. That way I could end up with a "baseline" to work from. After
that I would get more serious and would look for ways to incentivize
people based on the Zero Score that they had control over. At that
point, I would really engage with the people who were committed to
help them change their processes to get to a 0 on their Zero Score.

# Zero Score Implications #
The Zero Score implies that every "touch" your organization makes other
than an initial sales inquiry should be outbound. It is an audacious
goal that assumes your organization knows more than it probably does
right now. I have found though that some people do amazing work when a lot is
expected and other people "up their game" too because they don't want
to look bad to the group.


# Simple Is Good #
Think about it. It's relatively easy to capture. It can be "rolled up"
to the entire organization by time periods like day, week, or month.
It could even be sliced into "hours of the day" or even by divisions
like "sales" or "service" or even "accounting". You could do
derivative such as Zero Score / transactions or Zero Score / revenue to compare across units with
different sales volumes. This is a useful metric!
