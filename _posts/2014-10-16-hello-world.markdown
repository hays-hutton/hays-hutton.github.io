### Start here and drive a nail through it.

Like most coders when I come across something new that I want to evaluate, such as a new database, a new programming language or even a blogging platform, I "drive a nail through it". This means I get a very simple implementation up and running. Doing this gives me a sense of the complexities involved. It also exposes me to some of the philosophy of the people that built the tool I am evaluating. This very blog post is a "nail" being driven through the [jekyllrb blogging software][1] and [github pages hosting environment][2]. I like them both.
