### What Is Net Promoter?

If you read my previous post [Blue Ocean Strategy][1], then you are aware that we made a strategic decision that customer service was really the most important thing we did. In order to achieve world class satisfaction levels, we embraced the entire Net Promoter System very much like the video above.

### Step 1: Sort Customers

In order to execute and manage the entire Net Promoter process, we hired a full time employee to run our Net Promoter program. From capturing data to compiling reports to initiating our recovery process, we had one person centrally manage this. It wasn't free by any means, but as I look back I believe that this was one of the best resource allocation decisions I have ever made. We called every client to ask the ultimate question.    

### Step 2: Close the Loop

When promoters asked us what they could do to help us, we pushed them to social media, asked them to refer others, and even suggested they contact our newest target customer the insurance agent. While this positive feedback capture was great, the more important process was the recovery process. The staff turned most detractors into raving fans of our business. Turning these detractors into promoters appeared expensive. At first, it even upset some of our staff because we handled things that weren't even our fault which made them feel bad. In the end it was the most effective marketing dollars I have ever seen spent.

### Step 3: Make Loyalty A Top Priority

We used technology to calculate and distribute NPS scores sliced multiple ways. These reports were distributed daily with a month to date rolling score. We also broke the reports down into different views such as insurance carrier, insurance agent, shop level, and market level. All of this was shared to everyone everyday.

Not only was this info valuable and available, it was also the driver of front line managers' bonus plans. Ranges of Net Promoter Scores at the shop level for the month drove the amount of profit that was bonused. Operations managers were tied to good profits. Good profits were shared.

## A Simple Metric, Consistently Applied

The Net Promoter System was a very effective tool to drive operations to execute a customer service strategy. Obviously, it isn't the perfect tool for every strategy but it's wholistic approach when implemented correctly is a model for many types of operational tactics.
